# Sato Quasi-Complex

A computational framework for analyzing quasi-complex manifolds through Sato's hyperfunction theory.

## Overview

This repository implements a novel approach to studying integrability of almost complex structures using Mikio Sato's hyperfunction theory and topos-theoretic methods. Instead of relying on classical Nijenhuis tensor computations, we develop cohomological obstruction theory that reveals the global topological structure underlying integrability problems.

## The Problem

Classical complex geometry relies on the **Newlander-Nirenberg theorem**: an almost complex structure is integrable (comes from a genuine complex structure) if and only if its Nijenhuis tensor vanishes. However:

- **Computational Challenge**: Nijenhuis tensor calculations are notoriously difficult and provide little geometric insight
- **Limited Scope**: Classical methods only give binary answers (integrable/non-integrable) 
- **Missing Structure**: No systematic framework for understanding *why* or *how* integrability fails

## Our Approach

We propose analyzing **quasi-complex manifolds** (manifolds with possibly non-integrable almost complex structures) using:

1. **Sato Hyperfunctions**: Generalized functions defined cohomologically that naturally encode analytic singularities
2. **Microlocal Compatibility**: Instead of requiring functions to match across charts, we require their singular representations to be microlocally compatible  
3. **Topos Theory**: The global hyperfunction sheaf lives in the topos of the manifold's cover, providing the proper geometric framework
4. **Cohomological Obstructions**: Integrability becomes equivalent to vanishing of certain cohomology classes

## Key Innovation

**Classical Approach:**
```
Almost Complex Structure J → Compute Nijenhuis N_J → Check if N_J = 0
```

**Our Approach:**
```
Quasi-Complex Manifold → Hyperfunction Sheaves → Microlocal Gluing → Cohomological Obstructions → Rich Geometric Information
```

## What This Framework Reveals

- **Global Structure**: Topological obstructions invisible to pointwise tensor methods
- **Position-Dependent Information**: Where and how integrability fails
- **Microlocal Data**: Directional information about singularities
- **Systematic Classification**: Organize quasi-complex manifolds by their obstruction types
- **Computational Tractability**: Automated analysis pipeline

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/sato-quasi-complex.git
cd sato-quasi-complex
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- SymPy (symbolic computation)
- NumPy (numerical arrays)
- Optional: Jupyter notebooks for examples

## Quick Start

```python
from sato_quasi_complex import *

# Define coordinates
x, y, u, v = symbols('x y u v', real=True)

# Create non-integrable almost complex structure
J_matrix = Matrix([
    [0, -1,  0,  0],
    [1,  0,  0,  0], 
    [0,  x,  0, -1],  # The 'x' creates non-integrability
    [0,  0,  1,  0]
])

# Set up quasi-complex manifold with two charts
manifold = create_example_manifold(J_matrix, coordinates=[x,y,u,v])

# Analyze integrability
hf_cohom = HyperfunctionCohomology(manifold)
obstructions = hf_cohom.analyze_integrability()

# Output: 
# NON-INTEGRABLE: Found 1 obstruction class
# α₁ = [x · dy ⊗ δ_v] ∈ H¹(U₁₂, Ω^{0,1} ⊗ WF)
# Integrability condition: x = 0
```
